# Instacart_project

## SCENARIO
Instacart is an existing online grocery store operating through an app which has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns and apply targeted marketing. The conducted analysis answers business questions and provides recommendations for the marketing strategy based on the insights discovered.

## PROJECT DATASET
- Open source data set accessed from [following link](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)
- 4 Datasets including information about: orders, products, customers, departments

## TOOLS USED
-	Python/ Pandas for data manipulation
-	Python / Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualisations
-	IDEs: Jupyther Notebook and MS Visual Studio Code
- MS Excel for final report

## TASKS PERFORMED
- [x] Loaded datasets into an IDE
- [x] Performed data consistency checks and data wrangling
- [x] Analysed the data with Python Pandas to answer the following business questions:

 1. What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
  2. Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
  3. Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
  4. Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
  5. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)? 
  6. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  7. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  8. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
  9. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Family status?

- [x] Created visualizations with Python Matplotlib / Seaborn to make the answers easier consumable for the stakeholders
- [x] Created a population flow to demostrate changes (cleaning, merging, filtering) in the dataset
- [x] Prepared an Excel report with population flow, checks performed, data wrangling steps, column derivations, visualisations, answers and recommendations
